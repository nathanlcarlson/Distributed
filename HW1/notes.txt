I created a class to keep track of the state of the game. The server starts the game, passes input to the protocol class, sends output and ends the game. I check to make sure the client is entering a number and make sure to update the number between games with a new random number. The client can't connect if the server is not running and the run-client command fails. The client may enter q to quit.
